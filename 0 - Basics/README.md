# Data Structures and Algorithms Basics

This section (`section-0`) will cover the basic (essentials) needed for any new person getting into understanding Data Structures and Algorithms. We endevour to make is as beginner friendly as it can get.

Intermediate to Advanced topics will be covered in the sections to follow.

## Proposed Topics
The following are the proposed topics for this section:

- Sorting Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Recursion
- Abstract Data Structures:
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Linked Lists
- Asymptotic Analysis: The Big-Oh Notation

Not decided whether to include in Section 0:

- Heaps and Heapsort
- Trees (basics)
- Graphs (basics)
- Graph Traversal: BFS and DFS

## Structure for Each Topic

```
+ Topic Folder Name
  - Subtopic Folder Name (if any)
    - README.md (for the topic/subtopic)
      - this will contain:
        (1) Brief explanation of the topic
        (2) Link to recommended resources for that topic
        (3) A commentary on that topic with examples from various libraries/projects where this has been used, e.g. Array.sort() in JavaScript, what type of sort is it? Can we get to the actual code and walk through?
```
