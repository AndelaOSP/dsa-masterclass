**Issue Description:**
TBD

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A folder/directory in the root of `0 - Basics` named `01 - Sorting Algorithms`, i.e. `0 - Basics/01 - Sorting Algorithms`
- folder for each of the algorithms and a README.md outlining:
  - (1) Brief explanation of the topic
  - (2) Link to recommended resources for that topic
  - (3) A commentary on that topic with examples from various libraries/projects where this has been used, e.g. Array.sort() in JavaScript, what type of sort is it? Can we get to the actual code and walk through?
